# EyeSnap
EyeSnap project is designed to predict various types of eye diseases based on uploaded eye images. It utilizes deep learning techniques, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on a dataset of eye disease images. Transfer learning techniques, including Inception V3, VGG19, and Xception V3, are employed for enhanced accuracy.
